              Our multidimensional academic programs free students from
              conventional boundaries, allowing them to learn deeply from many
              perspectives. They can explore courses across our colleges and
              disciplines and become immersed in multiple areas of learning
              related to their areas of interest. The benefits of this academic
              freedom are enormous.
